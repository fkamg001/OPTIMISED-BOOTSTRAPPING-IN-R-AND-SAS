# OPTIMISED-BOOTSTRAPPING-IN-R-AND-SAS
The purpose of this project is to take a simple bootstrapping function and apply the optimisation techniques in order to improve the speed, efficiency and flexibility of the function. 
Bootstrapping generates 95% confidence intervals for parameter estimates without requiring any distributional assumptions. 
This is completed by resampling with replacement from the available data. 
With high repetition, more robust estimates can be generated with lower sampling uncertainty. In the current report, I will introduce two approaches to bootstrapping optimisation by looking at its implementation via two softwares: RStudio [2] and SAS [3].
